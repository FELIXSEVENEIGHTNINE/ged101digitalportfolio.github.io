				<p>
					I included my own metacognitive reading to my portfolio because I want this to be where I show my skills at understand the reading material given. 
					This is mostly siding on how well I can understand the given article and try to decode what it is trying to say.
					It might be a different intepretation and could show my proficiency towards languages only using context clues.

				<p>
					I included my reflection on the group activity as this shows my connection towards people.
					It shows how well I can understand people and what they're saying, similar to the previous activity.
					It could also be how I relate to other people when it comes to the same event or situation they are also experiencing.

				<h1>ACTIVITY 3 - SPIRITUAL REFLECTION</h1>
				<iframe src="NERIA_REFLECTION.pdf" title="Reflection" allowfullscreen="true" loading="eager"></iframe>

					Finally, I included my spritual reflection paper as it shows my religion as a person.
					This affects on what I believe in and how I should do it and how I should show it.
					It also shows how I think about myself and how I can improve myself without other people trying to tell me to improve.
